        <p>2048 is played on a gray 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player
             moves them using the four keys(1,2,3,4 to imply left , right, up , down directions).
            Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of 
            either 2 or 4. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped
            by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide
            while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that 
            collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. If a 
            move causes three consecutive tiles of the same value to slide together, only the two tiles
             farthest along the direction of motion will combine. If all four spaces in a row or column are
            filled with tiles of the same value, a move parallel to that row/column will combine the first
             two and last two.
